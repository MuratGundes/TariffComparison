# Tariff Comparison

## Getting Started

Develop a model to build up the following two products and to compare these products based on their annual costs. The comparison should accept the following input parameter:  
• Consumption (kWh/year)  
and create a list of these products with the columns  
• Tariff name  • Annual costs (€/year)  

The list should be sorted by costs in ascending order.  

### Products  

1. Product A  
Name: “basic electricity tariff”  
Calculation model: base costs per month 5 € + consumption costs 22 cent/kWh 

Examples:  
```
• Consumption = 3500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 830 €/year (5€ * 12 months = 60 € base costs + 3500 kWh/year * 22 cent/kWh = 770 € consumption costs)  
• Consumption = 4500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 1050 €/year (5€ * 12 months = 60 € base costs + 4500 kWh/year * 22 cent/kWh = 990 € consumption costs)  
• Consumption = 6000 kWh/year => Annual costs = 1380 €/year (5€ * 12 months = 60 € base costs + 6000 kWh/year * 22 cent/kWh = 1320 € consumption costs)    
```


2. Product B  
Name: “Packaged tariff”  
Calculation model: 800 € for up to 4000 kWh/year and above 4000 kWh/year additionally 30 cent/kWh.  

Examples: 
``` 
• Consumption = 3500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 800 €/year   
• Consumption = 4500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 950 €/year (800€ + 500 kWh * 30 cent/kWh = 150 € additional consumption costs)  
• Consumption = 6000 kWh/year => Annual costs = 1400 €/year (800€ + 2000 kWh * 30 cent/kWh = 600 € additional consumption costs)  
```
